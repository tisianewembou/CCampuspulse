# CampusPulse

CampusPulse is a lightweight web-based application that enables university students to provide real-time, anonymous feedback on classroom conditions. Designed for simplicity, speed, and privacy, the platform facilitates better communication between students and instructors, especially in large lecture settings.

## Features

- **Noise Checker:** Students can rate the classroom's noise level as High, Medium, or Low.
- **Mood of the Week:** Students submit daily mood check-ins. At the end of the week, the most frequent mood is displayed to reflect the collective atmosphere.
- **Lecture Pace Feedback:** Quick feedback on whether the lecture is too fast, too slow, or appropriately paced.
- **Anonymous Interaction:** No login required. All feedback is submitted anonymously to encourage honest input.
- **Responsive Design:** Built to work across desktop and mobile browsers.

## Built With

- HTML – Structure and layout
- CSS – Styling and responsive design
- JavaScript – Client-side interactivity

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tisianewembou/CCampuspulse.git
2. Navigate to project folder: cd CCampuspulse
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.

## Project Motivation

In large university classrooms, real-time feedback often gets lost or overlooked. CampusPulse was created to bridge that gap, giving students an easy, low-pressure way to voice how they're feeling—helping instructors adjust in real-time and ultimately improving the learning experience for everyone.

## Future Improvements
- Data persistence using localStorage or backend integration
- Real-time analytics dashboard for instructors
- Mood history tracking per term
- Enhanced accessibility and multilingual support
